This mod adds different kinds of sea life to the game.  There are no interations with the animals as they are intended for ambience, so no you can't go whaling in this mod.

Requires BepInEx5.
* Install to your BepInEx plugins folder.

# Features:
* Spawns animals around your boat.
* Removes animals which get too far away from you so you don't have whales doing their thing in Aestrin while you're visiting Fire Fish Lagoon.
* Rudimentary collision avoidance.
* Animals spawn in at random sizes.
* Random behaviors, such as surfacing and breaching.
* Particle effects where appropriate.
* Animals follow the height of the waves.
* Animals have collision, so they can bump into you and your boat so be careful.  Larger animals can cause problems if a whale were to say, accidentally breach into your boat.

# Known issues:
* Animals don't render in fog correctly.  I'll fix this if I figure it out but it's a problem for now.
* Animals sometimes swim through terrain and other objects instead of avoiding them.

I'll add more animals as I have the time and motivation for.

# Current animals:
* Fin Whale, a 26 meter baleen whale.
